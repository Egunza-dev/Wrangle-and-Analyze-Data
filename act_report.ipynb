    "#### 1. Distribution of Variables of Interest\n",
    "- A histogram of the rating_numerator variable depicts the data as being left skewed. Most data points lie between 10 to 13 with 12 being the most frequent rating_numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hostogram](images/hist_rating.png)\n",
    "- A histogram of the retweet_count variable depicts the data as being right-skewed. Most data points lie between 0 and 2500.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hostogram](images/hist_retweet.png)\n",
    "- A histogram of the favorite_count variable depicts the data as being right-skewed. Most data points lie between 0 and 5000.\n",

    "![Hostogram](images/hist_favorite.png)\n",
    "#### 2. Relationship between Variables of interest \n",
    "- There's strong correlation between retweet_count and favorite_count variables with correlation coefficient of 0.7. A scatter plot of retweet_count against favorite_count depict most data points showcasing a linear relationship between the two variables.\n",

    "![Scatter](images/scatter.png)\n",
    "      \n",
    "- There's weak correlation between rating_numerator and retweet_count with correlation coefficient of 0.29 and between rating_numerator and favorite_count variables with correlation coefficient of 0.34. A scatter plot of rating_numerator against favorite_count and rating_numerator against retweet_count depict data points showcasing lack of linear relationship between the variables.\n",

    "**Most Frequent Dog Breeds**\n",
    "- For the image predictions that were true dog breeds, golden_retriever, Labrador_retriever, Pembroke and Chihuahua respectively were the most frequent in the case of the first prediction.\n",
    "- For the image predictions that were true dog breeds, Labrador_retriever, golden_retriever, Cardigan and Chihuahua respectively were the most frequent in the case of the second prediction.\n",
    "- For the image predictions that were true dog breeds, Labrador_retriever, Chihuahua and golden_retriever respectively were the most frequent in the case of the third prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proportion of True Dog Breeds Predictions**\n",
    "- In the case of the first prediction involving dog images, only 4.73% of the predictions made were true dog breeds.\n",
    "- In the case of the second prediction involving dog images, only 4.85% of the predictions made were true dog breeds.\n",
    "- In the case of the third prediction involving dog images, only 4.98% of the predictions made were true dog breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence Level of Predictions**\n",
    "- In the case of the first prediction of dog images, 63.52% of the true dog breeds predictions made had confidence level equal to or greater than 0.5.\n",
    "- In the case of the second prediction of dog images, none of the true dog breeds predictions made had confidence level equal to or greater than 0.5.\n",
    "- In the case of the third prediction of dog images, also none of the true dog breeds predictions made had confidence level equal to or greater than 0.5."
